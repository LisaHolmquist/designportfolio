            <h2>The Problem:</h2>
            <p>I needed to find a way to <span>present my body of work in an appealing, professional, and easy to read manner</span>. However, I didn't have much exposure to the professional world of UX. I was unsure what was expected of a UX portfolio. <span>What was most important to present and how? What did I need to work on to be job ready and have a polished portfolio?</span></p>

            <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
            <p>Finding what information is the most important to present to users. <span>What is the primary purpose of the site? What kind of emotion and experience would the users of this site need to experience for this site to succeed in its purpose?</span></p>

            <h2>The Solution:</h2>
            <p>I began by <span>researching top rated UX portfolios as well as looking through job listings that I wanted to eventually apply for.</span> I then decided on <span>branding and messaging</span>. This portfolio was <span>later changed due to findings in the curse of the original site's usage</span> in the job search.</p>

                        <div class="row">
                            <p>As I began working on my initial portfolio, I felt a great need to understand <span>what information was important to present as well as how to present it</span>. However, I did not have direct contact with recruiters or design managers so I set out to <span>research how to create a portfolio</span> on my own.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row">
                            <p>First, I needed to understand <span>what recruiters and design managers were looking for</span>. I sought out job listings that I was aiming to interview for, found the section of essential skills and experience for said jobs, and <span>jotted down various skills and concepts that they were looking for</span>. Two examples of these job listings are shown below:</p>

                            <p><span>After establishing my understanding of what companies were looking for, I set out to understand how portfolios are typically organized.</span> I searched the best rated UX design portfolios and sorted through each listed. <span>What made these portfolios special? How were they presenting their case studies? What was their visual representation to written explanation ratio? What did their general navigation look like?</span></p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row">
                            <p>I studied two portfolios in particular, that of Olivia Truong and Stephanie Lawrence. The image below is a screenshot of Olivia Truong's portfolio. Her case studies were presented in about 50% imagery and 50% written explanation. <span>I felt that her case studies felt a very linear format and told a compelling design story. I also adored the hand drawn images that she included as she explained her process.</span></p>

                            <p>The image below shows a screenshot from Stephanie Lawrence's portfolio. What I really found compelling about her case studies was how short they were. <span>She established what her plan was and how her research directed her design process and decisions and beyond that, her case studies were presented in a very brief fromat making them very easy and quick to read and understand.</span></p>

                        <div class="row">
                            <p>I initially went into the visual design process with the intention of having a <span>very graphic portfolio while remaining professional and conveying key information effectively</span>. Below, you can see my original mood board and UI style guide. I wanted to use some "unconventional" colors. I felt that blue, for example, is used a lot and I really <span>wanted to push my visual narrative into something that feels more fresh and interesting</span>. I also used some feminine typography that I felt was still <span>bold and clean</span>.</p>

                    <h4>Initial Design:</h4>
                        <div class="row">
                            <p>When beginning my original design, I took some inspiration from the design sensibilities of Olivia Truong, mentioned earlier. She had very visually appealing imagery for her hero images of each page. They were <span>interesting, graphic, and clean</span>. I wanted to go a slightly different direction but still maintain this graphic feel. I, therefore, went for a more <span>retro visual design, almost like the feeling of a 70's graphic tee</span>. However, after creating this initial design, I felt that <span>it wasn't very representative of the feeling I wanted to evoke visually</span>. I did like the space in the design to keep things simple and clean but ultimately decided to redesign this to create something a bit more graphically striking.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row text-center justify-content-center images">

                <h3>Final Design</h3>
                        <div class="row">
                            <p>I pushed and pulled for quite awhile with different styles and imagery. Eventually, I found a couple references of fashion and photography websites that I found very <span>visually striking</span>. With these images and concepts in mind, I designed the homepage found below. The logo of the lotus was a logo I created and used previously for my freelance animation accounts. I felt that it would be <span>important to maintain consistency throughout my online presence</span> and, therefore, added the logo on the homepage as well.</p>

                        <div class="row">
                            <p>I went with a similar idea that I had on my original design for the presentation of my body of work. Having the case study title, mock-up example, and link to read more all presented together. In this case I also <span>added a small summary of the case study, my role in it, and the timeframe that it was designed in. Overall, I feel that this page succeeded but maybe could be simplified visually.</span></p>

                            <p>My About page was quite simple with a summary of me and where I came from along with why I am passionate about UX design. <span>However, as shown below, I also added a section that was a graphic representation of my hard and soft skills. Frankly, I feel that this was a poor and inaccurate way to represent skill proficiency and, therefore, did away with this section for my current site.</span></p>

                            <p>From the launch of the original site I had <span>Google Analytics attached in the code in order to monitor how users were using the site</span> after I began the application process. I have attached a few examples of the results below. The first one shows the <span>trajectory of users visiting the site</span>. The beginning spike, I decided, is inaccurate as I was ironing out some bugs in the code still so a lot of those user visits were me testing the site on different devices while also filling out initial job applications. At first, I found the number of users dissappointing but I did feel that this showed that <span>my resume potentially needed a little work in order to channel recruiters to my site more frequently</span>. On the right of the graph you can see a <span>small spike in visiting users which was right after I made resume adjustments, showing that my changes to my resume were successful</span> in getting past the initial sorting process of job applications.</p>

                            <p><span>Some of the most useful information, however, came from a few chance meetings with experienced designers in the field.</span> First, I went to a product design and product management conference in Salt Lake City, Utah called the Front Conference. I met so many incredible designers, researchers, and product managers there who gave me a lot of incredible advice and encouragement. A couple things really stood out to me from what they told me. <span>One designer was also a web developer and they told me of something called Hotjar which is a heat mapping tool for websites so I could get even more useful information than I was getting from Google Analytics alone, such as where exactly were the users spending their time on each page. This would enable me to further finetune each page on my site for my specific users.</span></p>

These notes became essential to the redesign of my new portfolio site.</span></p>

                            <p><span>An even more important question than what did I learn is what did I do with what I learned.</span> After gathering everything I had learned over the months I decided to do a complete revamp of my entire portfolio. I wanted to have a site that was more graphically striking. I wanted to incorporate more hand drawn animations in each page to show a little more of what I am working on in my current role. <span>I combined my animation and UX portfolios, adding an animation tab seen above and added a lot of navigation and scanibility features for recruiters and hiring managers to find exactly what they are seeking.</span> Examples of these changes can be seen below. Please feel free to explore the site as much as you'd like. This site was completely hand coded as teh site before it. A lot of love, care, time, and consideration went into every aspect of this site so please enjoy!</p>
