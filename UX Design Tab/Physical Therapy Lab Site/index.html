            <h2>The Problem:</h2>
            <p>The current Physical Therapy Lab site has <span>confusing navigation, no clear information hierarchy, and unreadable text blocks.</span> What is most important for users in the site? How can the site help direct the flow of business for Physical Therapy Lab?</p>

            <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
            <p>Two primary challenges presented themselves in this site redesign. First, what are users' intentions when visiting the site? Where is the knowledge gap, if any, between patients and this kind of physical therapy? Second, what are the business goals of Physical Therapy Lab with regards to this site? How would they prefer to have users utilize the site? How would they like users to be directed?</p>

            <h2>The Solution:</h2>
            <p><span>Understand users' intentions when visiting the site. Discover what a user needs to know when considering this kind of treatment. Understand the goals of the business with regards to the site.</span></p>

                            <p>I first began this redesign process by <span>analyzing the current site.</span> I circled areas and annotated possible design concerns regarding each section. <span>I felt this would be helpful for me and my client to review to understand what may be causing user frustration with the site. It also helped facilitate discussion with my client regarding information hierarchy.</span> What was most important/necessary for users when visiting the site? As his site is primarily utilized to inform users on different treatments and services as well as schedule appointments, it was imperative that the site is stripped of anything that is not aimed towards these functions.</p>

                            <p><span>After analyzing various design elements in the current site, I felt that the most important thing to understand was the knowledge gap of users when visiting a site for pelvic floor therapy.</span> What information would a user be primarily searching for? What information was important for them to understand before starting treatment? <span>To find this information I began by taking advantage of Google's algorithm.</span> I searched things like "pelvic floor physical therapy" and "what is pelvic floor physical therapy?" I then scrolled down to the google sections titled "People also ask" and "Related questions." This helped me understand some of the information searched by potential patients. A couple screenshots of these results can be found below. <span>This exercise helped me understand how information should be prioritized on the new site.</span></p>

                                    <p>At this time I also <span>sent out a survey</span> on Facebook (to target the local audience) to understand what potential users already know about pelvic floor physical therapy as well as what they feel they would need to know in order to start treatment. <span>However, when reviewing the results of the survey I felt that there were not enough respondents (50) to make any decisive conclusions.</span></p>

                                    <p>I did, however, feel that I still needed more information resulting from a large pool of people to understand more of why people don't seek pelvic floor physical therapy when needed. With this goal in mind, I went searching for studies with large groups of people and found the results displayed to the right showing that <span>the primary reason patients don't get pelvic floor therapy is feeling uncomfortable due to the intimate nature of the practice.</span></p>

However, I still <span>wanted to discuss business goals with my client to understand how the website fits into these goals.</span> These would include how the business would prefer patients to use the site. Would they like scheduling to primarily be through the site? Do they prefer to inform patients in person about different services or would they like that information present on the site to facilitate the scheduling of appointments?</p>

In this meeting she informed me that <span>she would prefer current and future patients do their appointment scheduling through the site and the site to bridge many knowledge gaps for potential patients to make them as comfortable as possible in their knowledge when seeking treatment.</span> As we discussed these business goals we also discussed various possible solutions for the different needs and goals of the website.

I brought these first three design concepts to a meeting with the business owner to discuss why I chose to design them the way I did and the general feeling I tried to evoke with each design.

                        <div class="row">
                            <p>After looking over the first design round, <span>the client asked to include specific elements and add them to the next design round.</span> These elements included a photo of one of her employees with her son on the homepage as the hero image, the gif of a running woman found on the original website with a statement, an image of an award they were recently nominated for, and more use of the color purple.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row">
                            <p><span>I felt that this many elements could make the design cluttered but I did my best to still make the design cohesive and clean. My primary goal was still to direct user traffic quickly and easily to the primary purposes of the website, scheduling an appointment, learning about services, and learning a little about the staff to help users feel safe in seeking treatment.</span></p>

                            <p>We officially began development in Squarespace after the second round of design. The client was already using this platform for their current site and felt most comfortable sticking with it to make updating their content easier if necessary.</p>

                                    <p><span>The client decided she didn't want the primary navigation icons as quick navigation buttons and only wanted a quick call button alongside the other main navigation at the top of the page.</span> As online <span>scheduling was the primary business goal for the website, I then suggested we use a fixed position for the top navigation</span> to have it scroll with the user. This would help with easy navigation on the main page to replace the previously used icons and make navigation easier on other pages when scrolling.</p>
