            <p>Information in the Department of Education website is difficult to find as <span>too much information is presented at once and many titles and descriptions do not fit the information given</span>. The site also is poorly organized causing user's to feel overwhelmed when searching.</p>

            <p>Who is the primary user of the site? <span>What content on the site is the highest priority for our users?</span> How can we organize so much content to have a smooth user experience while still having all information readily available?</p>

            <p><span>Redesign the user interface as well as the navigation system</span> for the Department of Education website in <span>desktop and mobile</span> formats.</p>

                            <p>Through initial independent investigation, I found that the site had a lot of <span>information for student loans and grants but this information was hidden among information clutter and poor navigation systems</span>. Having found this, I felt it was prudent to conduct <span>user testing of the current user base</span> with the following tasks:</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row">

                            <p>I conducted five user tests and found the following three redesign priorities:</p>

                                <p>I studied and evaluated each section of the user path using a scoring system for heuristics to <span>pinpoint the central existing problems with the current site</span>. Through these scores. I found the essential issues with the site were in its appearance/aesthetics. However, there wasn't a small amount of issues in the content section as well. Due to this, <span>I focused primarily on appearance/aesthetic as well as clear content prioritization of the site.</span></p>

                            <p><span>I first created categories based on the categories that already existed on the website.</span> I then organized the secondary pages and links accordingly.

                        <div class="row">
                            <p>I then got rid of said categories all together and <span>reorganized the cards once again based on themes</span> that I saw within them.

                            <p>In redesigning the sitemap. I found the <span>"Student Loans/Grants" and "Laws" sections proved the most difficult to design</span>.</p>

                        <div class="row">
                            <p><span>The loans section was difficult to organize as there is a lot of information contained on this page.</span> It is also the highest priority for users as this is the primary reason users use the site.

                            <p><span>The laws section has a great amount of information and jargon.</span> This causes user confusion and stress as they had read through a lot of law titles and descriptions to find what they were looking for. In organizing this content, I first <span>read brief descriptions of each law to discover what they were regarding</span>. I then <span>divided the laws into two categories</span>, laws for students and guardians and laws for educators and schools. <span>Under these two categories, I then organized the laws alphabetically.</span></p>

                            <p><span>I kept the original Department of Education logo, but wanted the header to display the site title better</span> so I centered the logo and title and shifted the search bar to the far right side. I also shifted the "Information about..." section to the left and adjusted the spacing and font to add some space for the user to breathe and feel less overwhelmed. These changes allowed the space needed to display primary content in a bolder fashion, showing users the site's purpose immediately.</p>

Apple. Apple's mobile site's footer was clean, only including tiles but being expandable. Almost like a burger menu that didn't need to be pulled up.
