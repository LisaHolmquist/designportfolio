            <h2>The Problem:</h2>
            <p>Prime Video currently is <span>not organized in a way that encourages users to use it</span> and has <span>no incentives</span> for users to utilize it as their primary streaming service.</p>
        
            <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
            <p>The team went into this case study with the idea that a redesign was needed for the browser version of Prime Video. This platform was <span>unorganized, chaotic, and difficult to use for users</span>. However, we quickly found that the <span>smart tv was the primary platform for streaming consumption and this platform</span> was very user friendly. <span>The team had to pivot several times</span> in order to create a polished and thoughtful <span>redesign that was in great need by Prime Video users</span>.</p>
        
            <h2>The Solution:</h2>
            <p><span>Understand the kind of experience that users need and desire when choosing their primary streaming service.</span> Finding a way, through research, to <span>innovate the streaming service experience</span> to position Prime Video as the primary streaming service.</p>

Streaming services are their main platform for movie and series entertainment.<br>4. Users are looking for something specific on Prime Video. Not just browsing.<br>5. Users use Prime Video as a "last resort" when unable to find a desired show/movie on their primary streaming service.</p>

                            <p><span>Our survey indicated that users' primary streaming services are 57.7% Netflix, 15.5% Hulu, and 13.4% HBO Max with all other streaming services making up the last 13.4%.</span> Knowing this information, we primary aimed our competitor analysis towards Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Max. We felt it vital to the design process to understand the current model of the most popular streaming services. <span>How are these services organized? What makes these services special (are there any unique qualities to these services?) How are these streaming services positioned in a branding sense?</span></p>

                    <h4>Heuristic Evaluation:</h4>
                        <div class="row">
                            <p>We initially did a heuristic evaluation on the browser version of Prime Video early on in our design process. However, after our user intervices and survey results were compiles, we felt it prudent to redo a heuristic evaluation of the smart tv app. We gathered images of different screens of the tv app and evaluated the current state of organization, aesthetic consistency and choices, and ease of user flow.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row bottomPar">
                            <p><span>In doing this evaluation we came to find that only small changes needed to be done in reorganization and the overall state of the app was user friendly and well organized.</span> However, we recognized that users still do not utilize Prime Video as their primary streaming service. Therefore, we decided that <span>Prime Video was in need of branding respositioning with a unique identity appealing to the current and potential users of streaming services.</span></p>

                <h3>Research Conclusions</h3>
                    <h4>Primary Takeaway:</h4>
                        <div class="row bottomPar">
                            <p>Research concluded that users didn't have major issues with Amazon Prime Video and that no major redesign was necessary. <span>The primary issue is that Prime Video is considered a rental service or "last resort" streaming service. Our team wanted to change this narrative by creating new features</span> that would make users return to Prime Video consistently.</p>
                        </div>
                    <h4>Nuances Found in Research:</h4>
                        <div class="row">
                            <p>After compiling our research, <span>we discussed as a team some possible behavioral and mental nuances that may exist between the lines of our research</span>. The following points were generally agreed upon:</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row bottomPar">
                            <p>1. User's main considerations when choosing streaming services were <span>ease of use, price, and exclusive content</span>.<br>2. Users <span>don't enjoy the need to rent movies</span> if they already have a subscription.<br>3. All users we interviewed and surveyed <span>shared their subscriptions with family/friends</span>.<br>4. Age and financial standing may contribute to users not being the primary account holders.<br>5. Ease of use was the largest consideration when choosing a streaming service and the majority of complaints we received about Prime Video specifically were related to ease of use. We concluded that theis may be ont he the primary reasons that <span>Prime Video is seen as a "last resort" streaming service</span>.</p>

We then recognized, <span>with a limited timeframe, it would be unrealistic to implement all the feature ideas we had and have a polished product on the other end</span>. With this in mind, we <span>grouped some ideas together that we felt fit under the same overarching idea and discussed, once again, our research results and what we felt would be most impactful for our users</span>. We recalled at this time, the fact that most users share their subscriptions with friends/family. We came to the conclusion that it would be wise to embrace this fact and possibly build upon it so that <span>users can be more social with their streaming services, especially with those they share a subscription with</span>. With these things in mind, we conducted another round of group voting in order to narrow our scope for this project.</p>

The friends on the couch would play the game from their mobile device and the primary account holder would play on the tv. Due to this, two flows were created, a television screen flow, using a tv controller to answer the trivia questions, and a mobile flow fot the other users to answer the trivia questions. Some of these screens can be seen below - <span>trivia quesitons pulled from IMDb, which is an Amazon owned company as we felt it prudent to utilize Amazon's current assets.</span></p>

                            <p>We added a step when navigating to the social profile to select the profile in the acount that the user is accessing. This was added to solve previous user feedback regarding using the general account versus an individual profile on the account. However, in mid-fi testing, many participants got stuck here with a few stating that <span>they thought that step was implied before even reaching the homescreen</span>. With this feedback in mind, we <span>rearranged the flow of profile selection to before the homescreen</span>.</p>

However, all participants first attempted navigation through the "Watch Party" tab rather than the "Social" tab.</span> In the final prototype, we movied the watch party invitation to the "Watch Party" tab to avoid this confusion.</p>

We found obvious branding components such as specific color palettes and fonts, but we also found a few things that were much more specific such as the degree of curve on the corners of the rectangular components, hover states, and button sizes. Understanding Amazon's current brand identity helped us <span>ensure branding consistency as well as an overall design ecosystem that made sense in each user flow</span>.</p>

The team created designs for this but becuase the <span>feature is very situational, we did not pursue it further</span>. We would like to have further research on the subject and potentially add this feature in a later stage.</p>
